# Dynamic Student Assessment - Test Client

## What this project is about

The Dynamic-Student-Assessment is a project for Codaisseur. The aim is to accurately measure the level of Javascript of potential students who sign up for the coding bootcamp. Better assessments of students Javascript level before they start the course, should increase the Bootcamp completion rate.

The test should measure students current level and give recommendations based on the results. The questions should change in complexity based on the provided student answers and level.
